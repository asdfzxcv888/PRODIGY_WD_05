integrated with a third-party called WeatherAPI, fetching weather data asynchronously using async/await keywords. Error handling mechanisms were implemented by me to manage potential API request or location retrieval errors. Utilizing the Geolocation API, I automatically retrieved the user's location if not manually inputted. I interacted with the DOM to dynamically update HTML content based on user input and fetched data. Additionally, I applied CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the web page, prioritizing user experience. My project organization followed best practices with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for clarity and separation of concerns.
